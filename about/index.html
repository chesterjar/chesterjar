<p>Hi, my name is Chester Jar, and I was born in Canberra, Australia. I was fortunate enough to immigrate to Canada in 1999, and have lived here ever since. In my spare time, I enjoy nature photography, and weightlifting. I started photography only recently, but I began weightlifting in 2012. I embraced fitness as a lifestyle, and with strict dieting, lost 25 pounds by the end of the year. This change of lifestyle would later inspire the path for my future.</p>

<p>As a full-time undergraduate student in the biomedical mechanical engineering program at the University of Alberta, I am currently in my second year of study. I chose engineering because the concept of applying scientific principles to real life scenarios and problem solving situations appealed to me from a very young age. Ever since elementary, I had a liking for science and mathematics (but also hated English!) and when graduation from high school came around the corner, I knew engineering was the right path for me. During my first year at university, many presentations were given to us to introduce us to different discplines. I took a particular interest in biomechanics due to my passion for fitness and the involvement of engineering and kinesiology. My ultimate goal in terms of career choices is to become a professor of biomedical mechanical engineering, and to conduct research to further advance knowledge involving mechanics of the human body.</p>
